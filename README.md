A set of files with some ATP data I have created from other sources.
Please note that any reference to ATP surface points is calculated based on the 2024-2025 ATP Points Rules.
This is part by design and part ease of creation. For our use case, it will likely work just fine.
An example is 2003 Andy Roddick will have ~twice as many surface points as he really had.
